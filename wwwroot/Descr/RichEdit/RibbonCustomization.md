The ASP.NET Core Rich Text Editor control allows you to provide a custom ribbon for your application. This demo shows how to display default and custom items in the ribbon. 

The ribbon tab’s [Items](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.Office.RibbonTabInfoBuilder-2.Items%28System.Action--1-%29) collection provides a set of methods that allow you to add default items to a ribbon (for instance, in this demo the [AddUndoItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.RichEdit.RichEditRibbonItemCollectionBuilder.AddUndoItem) and [AddRedoItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.RichEdit.RichEditRibbonItemCollectionBuilder.AddRedoItem) methods). 

Use the [AddButton](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.Office.RibbonItemCollectionBuilder-1.AddButton) method to populate the ribbon with custom items. To process the item click, handle the [OnCustomCommandExecuted](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.RichEdit.RichEditBuilder.OnCustomCommandExecuted%28System.String%29) event. The [commandName](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.CustomCommandExecutedEventArgs#js_DevExpress_RichEdit_CustomCommandExecutedEventArgs_commandName) event argument returns the clicked item’s [CommandName](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.Office.RibbonButtonItemBuilder.CommandName%28System.String%29) property value and allows you to identify the clicked item.
