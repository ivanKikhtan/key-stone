The [contextMenu](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.RichEdit#js_devexpress_richedit_richedit_contextmenu) property allows you to customize the DevExpress ASP.NET Core Rich Text Editor's context menu. You can handle the [contextMenuShowing](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.RichEdit.RichEditBuilder.OnContextMenuShowing%28System.String%29) event to additionally modify the menu before it is displayed. 

In this demo, the [contextMenu.items](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.IContextMenu#js_devexpress_richedit_icontextmenu_items) collection is customized on the [Init](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.RichEdit.RichEditBuilder.OnInit%28System.String%29) event. The [ContextMenuShowing](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.RichEdit.RichEditBuilder.OnContextMenuShowing%28System.String%29) event is handled to modify the collection based on the current selection. 

Click on a custom menu item raises the [CustomCommandExecuted](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.RichEdit.RichEditBuilder.OnCustomCommandExecuted%28System.String%29) event. The event handler identifies the clicked item by its name (the [e.commandName](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.CustomCommandExecutedEventArgs#js_devexpress_richedit_customcommandexecutedeventargs_commandname) property) and processes the item click (search the selected text in Google).
