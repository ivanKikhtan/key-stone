The DevExpress ASP.NET Core Rich Text Editor provides the Simple View mode to display documents ignoring the page's layout. In this mode, the control adjusts the document so that it occupies the entire control's content area.

You can enable the Simple View mode in the following ways:

- Click the **Simple View** Ribbon's command
- Set the [ViewType](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExpress.AspNetCore.RichEdit.ViewsSettingsBuilder.ViewType%28DevExpress.AspNetCore.RichEdit.ViewType%29) server-side property to **Simple**.
